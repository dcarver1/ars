Notes from Stephanie 

limited CWR 
? what is beeing collected 
? reaching out to BLM about their aquisition and prioritization 
  - based on the district level : do they decide how much seed goes where. 
  - Leah: what is being collecting 

SOS orders: 
  - intended use: primary uses within intended use are comprehensive 
  - intended use notes: second order rankings, are these correct, can we break them down more. 
  - dealing with other class


Confirm of SOS is collecting only BLM land or other lands? federal lands? 

add a quick map of distribution of hellianthus HELIANTHUS annuus
